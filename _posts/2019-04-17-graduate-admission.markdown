## What this blog post is about?
Graduate Admission Process is a daunting task requiring a great deal of effort, patience and sometimes a whole lot of money. The money part is not always true and there are always niches where you can go about saving a whole lot. Sometimes, if you are smart enough, you can practically get everything done with the smallest amount of investment as possible. My story is pretty much the laterally inverted version of that but I hope that it can act as a subtle feedback mechanism for anyone who is trying to throw open doors of educating themselves abroad. This is an elaborate post regarding how and when I started to think about getting an education abroad, how I prepared myself to try get into some of the great colleges and how I failed, my expectations and the real world equivalent of them and how I chose when there were stark choices available, both financially and opportunity wise. I hope this post will help you out to make an educated decision and put your priorities in order when you take *(most probably)* the most investing decision of life.

## Getting Started
Getting started with the graduate admission requires some thinking and investment of time and is not something that can be done in a fortnight. So make sure that before you go about thinking of getting an education abroad, you have ample time (probably \~1 year or so) to make educated decisions, apply for colleges, get feedback and go through the whole shebang of financial agreements and visa procedures. I have had my fair share of applying to colleges in the United States of America, Canada and Germany, so I would describe the timeframe according to the universities that I applied. The deadlines change depending on countries and even on universities so make sure to keep watching out respective universities' website for the most credible information.


I wilide this blog post into *num_section* where each section will develop on sections preceding it. The sections arided on the basis of time frames *i.e.* when I started preparing for the exams relevant to the procedure, when I started applying, approximately when I made the decision and finally when I decided to leave. Feel free to skip a section if it is something that you already know. I will link the particular sections as I refer to them in the subsequent ones.


## Section 1: The Sophomore Years of Undergraduate

There can be quite a lot of reasons why you would want to apply for a higher education degree and there might be a whole lot of other reasons why you would want to get it from abroad. These might range from gaining knowledge from the best people in your chosen field of expertise or can be as simple as getting a taste of another exquisite culture or perhaps a blend of all of those. For me, personally, it was during my sophomore years of undegraduate degree that I started to think about going for higher education and that too abroad. I really liked my field of study but perhaps I wanted more out of it. I did not have any predilection towards the curriculum which I was following and although I was pretty good at scoring marks at the university, I wasn't sure that I was being positively challenged to collaborate and think about the issues at hand *(this still has remained an issue but I believe I am making some progress thanks to the great community and courses around)*. The other push for me was to experience how life is beyond the border and how the geographical, topological and social characteristics define the personality of a person. In a nutshell, I wanted to see how can I gain more out of my work and life whilst also gaining knowledge on the way.

Subsequently, I decided to look out for what it takes to get yourself in a position to start applying for higher education abroad and my observations can be distilled into two main points:

* Decide on what you want to pursue when you graduate

  Deciding early on what you want to pursue when you graduate can be helpful when you go on developing your Resume and Statement of Purpose *(more about that later)*. Having said that, it is not a requirement that once you decided what you want to pursue you cannot change your field of study. Interests change even when you are completely focussed on something at hand *(especially during your undergraduate timeframe when you don't have a lot of experience with the field)*. So let yourself wander a bit but make sure when you pick up something to work upon, make it see the light of the day and don't leave it dangling. Everything that you pick up might look fairly flowery at the beginning *(akin to typing Hello World in your newly learned programming language)* but there exists a steep learning curve. Making sure sticking to your learning during that steep curve will not even help you make something out of it and not waste time but will also help you when you find something else to work upon *(as you find new opportunities in other fields and want to pursue them)*. I made mistakes trying to go through a whole lot of things during my sophomore year and not sticking to learning enough and that wasted a whole lot of my time that could have been put to some good use.

* Keep building stuff ... even when you feel like reinventing the wheel

  As a general rule of thumb when applying for great institutions abroad is to have a motivation that makes you pursue your chosen field of study and the ability to express it with your actions. Every institution would ask you to either send them a Statement of Purspose (SoP) or to send them an essay delineating your motivation and past experiences. The best way to tackle this *rather intimidating* piece of text is to get yourself building stuff. If you are pursuing a computer science degress *(as I was)*, you might want to go around building interesting web/mobile applications that tackle some problem to better showcase your work or if you are from a field where you can't build stuff as easily as a computer programmer, you might just write out what you are learning new. Apart from giving you a solid understanding of the subject matter, it will be a great point of discussing your motivation in the SoP and might also lead to your work getting recognized. Perhaps, it might also give you an upper hand when it comes to getting opportunities.

This section can be abbreviated simply by putting in the principle of **E(xplore)-L(earn)-B(uild)** before yourself. This is not limited to a good headstart for a successful application procedure but also if you want to make your sophomore years a better learning experience without blaming too much on the institutions in which you are studying. As a matter of fact, you should always keep talking about what you are learning with people like you *(internet is a great resource for that)* and even with the masters of the field. Who knows when you might meet someone who can help you out!


## Section 2: GRE, TOEFL and the Dawn of Applications

<p align="center">

</p>

Ideally you should start your preparation for the standardized tests a year and a half before joining the program of choice at your preferred university. Say you are applying for the Fall/Winter Semester (August - October) of 2018 at the university, then you should start preparing for the standardized tests during April-May of 2017 so that you have ample time to prepare and give these test as well as be ready (comfortably) with the scores as and when the application period starts. In the subsequent sections, I would talk a little about the two standardized tests, namely Graduate Record Examination(GRE) and Test for English as a Foreign Language(TOEFL) and a bit about how to approach the application procedure.


### Section 2.1 Graduate Record Examination (GRE)

GRE is one of the standardized tests that most of the universities abroad asks for when applying for postgraduate courses in almost all the fields of expertise except business and management (Look at GMAT for that). For undergraduate courses, SAT acts as a standardized measure but I won't be going into that. 

GRE consists of three parts, namely, Analytical Writing and Analysis, Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning. The cost of the registration for the exam is $150 but you can find the exact price according to their official website [here](https://www.ets.org/gre). Keep in the mind that the official website is the best source of information regarding the pattern of examination so I would recommend you to head [here](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about/content/) if you want to learn more. The preparation of GRE resolves around the three principles:

1. Getting to know the paper
   
   As you might have heard that GRE is not a rather tough examination which tests your subject specific knowledge but rather a it rather assesses your fundamental reasoning and interpretation skills. Given that, the quantitative aptitude paper revolves around simple (high school) mathematical concepts and the verbal reasoning revolves around english language skills and its underlying *(mostly cryptic)* vocabulary. Giving yourself ample time to understand the paper as you start going through the underlying subject matter is important for any exam but more so for GRE. The pattern of how and what type of questions are asked and how the solution as well as the question is presented can help in getting a fair idea about how to mentally prepare for the exam. Even if you are pretty much comfortable with the subject matter of GRE, it will be difficult to score in the above said sections if you take a whole lot of time deciphering how to answer. So make yourself comfortable with how questions are presented and whats the best way to reason about the solution for specific questions.

2. Procuring the study material
   
   The next thing for preparation is procuring the right study material and there are a bundle of choices that can be made in that. The best way to go around is to get materials from coaching institutes or buy them online so that you have enough questions to practice around. The most important part is to go through the [ETS workbooks](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/?WT.ac=gre_prepare_170731) and make sure you understand the latest pattern of questions. I personally did practice from the following four sources:
   * Jamboree practice books for both verbal and quant
   * Manhattan 5lb book for Reading Comprehensions
   * ETS Official Guide
   Another important bit is to get sufficiently acquainted with the exam scenario so as to mould your thinking ability in that direction. For this, I would recommend to give as many practice tests as possible. Effectively gauging performance helps in improving through areas where one is weak rather than blindly practicing a bunch of verbal questions and rote learning the vocabulary *(that you need to do nonetheless)*. I used these four resources to practice tests:
   * Kaplan Tests: Easy but good for starting out.
   * Jamboree Tests: More than enough difficult so difficult to gauge.
   * ETS Official Tests: There are 2 sets of tests. Give one a month and a half before the actual exam date and give one a week before the exam to effectively gauge your performance.
   * Manhattan Test: Good practice in general.

3. What about Analytical Writing and Assesment?  
   
   Analytical Writing and Assesment, abbreviated as AWA, should be given the least effort when preparing. But said that you MUST NOT take it lightly. Even if you got a perfect score in Quant and Verbal and got a really poor score in AWA, you might have to give the test again. Most of the institutions have a minimum score for AWA and getting a score above or equal to 3.5 is enough to qualify for most of the institutions. To prepare for AWA, read as much example questions and responses as you can and try to imitate their style when framing your own response. Whenever you are giving the full test as part of your preparation, make sure you also give AWA with it and analyse the written response by yourself. It will help you get into comfortable in dealing with AWA during the start of the test whilst also not spending too much of energy on this task.

In the end, GRE is all about practice. The more you do that and the more you have prior experience with reading comprehension, the better you can score in the exam. I would advise to sufficiently give time practicing quant as it can help you score better rather than dilly-dallying on verbal.

### Section 2.2 Test for English as a Foreign Language (ToEFL)

ToEFL focusses solely on English and contains four sections testing speaking, writing, reading and listening skills of the test taker. If you have already prepared for GRE and gone through that then it is relatively easier to get a good score in ToEFL. The tests does not comprise of rather cryptic vocabulary as you might find in GRE. The vocabulary and text is simple and mostly straightforward. The easiest way to prepare for ToEFL is to give sample tests which can be purchased from a vendor online or procured from coaching institutes. There is no need to go through excessive vocabulary for this test. Giving ToEFL official test (if I remember right it is a set of 10 tests) will be enough to get you a score above 90 and perhaps even above 100. Remember ToEFL exists as a formal requirement for many institutions abroad and most of them ask for a base score between 90 - 100 (depending on the country where you are applying). The cost of test is around $120 so make sure that you prepare enough that you don't need to give it more than once. The results of ToEFL arrive through E-mail in under 15 days so make sure that there is ample time between the deadline of applications and the arrival of ToEFL results. You can find most of the information on official ToEFL website [here](https://www.ets.org/toefl)

### Section 2.3 The application procedure

The application procedure varies greatly from university to university and the country where univeresity exists. On the contrary, there exists some generalisations among the application procedure which can be prepared in advance so that one can have a smooth application procedure. It is highly recommended to keep checking out the deadlines for universities by going to their admission page and keep a checklist of what documents need to be sent and how. In this subsection, I will try and delineate some general components of the application procedure which can give you an idea of what your prospective universities can ask you for.

  1. Test Scores:
     Test Scores for standardized exams such as GRE and ToEFL/IELTS are almost exclusively asked by all the institutions in North America. For institutions in Europe, however, it might depend on the university and the course you are applying for. Almost all of the institutions will ask for ToEFL/IELTS score as a fulfillment of language requirements. The scores are sent electronically after the examination is finished. You get to send scores to 4 universities for free in GRE and ToEFL (as soon as the test ends for GRE and during registration for ToEFL) and sending the rest of scores require you to submit an additional fee of $27 and $20 for GRE and ToEFL respectively. Make sure to note the institution code by browsing the university admission webpage when sending your scores to avoid any mistake.

  2. Letters of Recommendation:
     Letters of Recommendations, abbreviated as LoR, are one of the most important and most common part of the application university. These LoRs should be given from either your academic advisors (professors or research advisor) or can be given by someone from your organisation if you are a working professional. Make sure to check from the university website what type of Letter of Recommendation they require. A nice combination is to get two LoRs from your university professors and an LoR from industry professional/research advisor allowing you to give enough variety of recommendations from both academia and industry. Who you get your LoRs from makes a lot of difference. If someone who stands tall in the academic community gives you an LoR, then it will make substantial impact on your application procedure. Make sure you have cultivated a relationship with whom you are being recommended and have done either some projects or worked directly under them. Mostly, LoRs are sent electronically and the professor to whom you have submitted as a recommender will receive a link to directly upload an LoR in PDF/Word format. In addition, the recommender might also have to fill in a questionnaire having behavioral questions regarding the recommendee.

  3. Statement of Purpose:
