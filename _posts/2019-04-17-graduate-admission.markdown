## What this blog is about?

Graduate Admission Process is a daunting task requiring a great deal of effort, patience and sometimes a whole lot of money. The money part is not always true and there are always niches where you can go about saving a whole lot. Sometimes, if you are smart enough, you can practically get everything done with the smallest amount of investment as possible. My story is pretty much the laterally inverted version of that but I hope that it can act as a subtle feedback mechanism for anyone who is trying to throw open doors of educating themselves abroad. This is an elaborate post regarding how and when I started to think about getting an education abroad, how I prepared myself to try get into some of the great colleges and how I failed, my expectations and the real world equivalent of them and how I chose when there were stark choices available, both financially and opportunity wise. I hope this post will help you out to make an educated decision and put your priorities in order when you take *(most probably)* the most investing decision of life.

## Getting Started

Getting started with the graduate admission requires some thinking and investment of time and is not something that can be done in a fortnight. So make sure that before you go about thinking of getting an education abroad, you have ample time (probably \~1 year or so) to make educated decisions, apply for colleges, get feedback and go through the whole shebang of financial agreements and visa procedures. I have had my fair share of applying to colleges in the United States of America, Canada and Germany, so I would describe the timeframe according to the universities that I applied. The deadlines change depending on countries and even on universities so make sure to keep watching out respective universities' website for the most credible information.

I will divide this blog post into *num_section* where each section will develop on sections preceding it. The sections are divided on the basis of time frames *i.e.* when I started preparing for the exams relevant to the procedure, when I started applying, approximately when I made the decision and finally when I decided to leave. Feel free to skip a section if it is something that you already know. I will link the particular sections as I refer to them in the subsequent ones.

## Section 1: The Sophomore Years of Undergraduate

There can be quite a lot of reasons why you would want to apply for a higher education degree and there might be a whole lot of other reasons why you would want to get it from abroad. These might range from gaining knowledge from the best people in your chosen field of expertise or can be as simple as getting a taste of another exquisite culture or perhaps a blend of all of those. For me, personally, it was during my sophomore years of undegraduate degree that I started to think about going for higher education and that too abroad. I really liked my field of study but perhaps I wanted more out of it. I did not have any predilection towards the curriculum which I was following and although I was pretty good at scoring marks at the university, I wasn't sure that I was being positively challenged to collaborate and think about the issues at hand *(this still has remained an issue but I believe I am making some progress thanks to the great community and courses around)*. The other push for me was to experience how life is beyond the border and how the geographical, topological and social characteristics define the personality of a person. In a nutshell, I wanted to see how can I gain more out of my work and life whilst also gaining knowledge on the way.

Subsequently, I decided to look out for what it takes to get yourself in a position to start applying for higher education abroad and my observations can be distilled into two main points:

* Decide on what you want to pursue when you graduate

  Deciding early on what you want to pursue when you graduate can be helpful when you go on developing your Resume and Statement of Purpose *(more about that later)*. Having said that, it is not a requirement that once you decided what you want to pursue you cannot change your field of study. Interests change even when you are completely focussed on something at hand *(especially during your undergraduate timeframe when you don't have a lot of experience with the field)*. So let yourself wander a bit but make sure when you pick up something to work upon, make it see the light of the day and don't leave it dangling. Everything that you pick up might look fairly flowery at the beginning *(akin to typing Hello World in your newly learned programming language)* but there exists a steep curve for learning anything. Making sure that you stick to your learning during that steep curve will not even help you make something out of it and not waste time but will also help you when you find something else to work upon *(as you find new opportunities in other fields and want to pursue them)*. I made mistakes trying to go through a whole lot of things during my sophomore year and not sticking to learning enough and that wasted a whole lot of my time that could have been put to some good use.

* Keep building stuff ... even when you feel like reinventing the wheel

  As a general rule of thumb when applying for great institutions abroad is to have a motivation that makes you pursue your chosen field of study and the ability to express it with your actions. Every institution would ask you to either send them a Statement of Purspose (SoP) or to send them an essay delineating your motivation and past experiences. The best way to tackle this *rather intimidating* piece of text is to get yourself building stuff. If you are pursuing a computer science degress *(as I was)*, you might want to go around building web/mobile applications to better showcase your work or if you are from a field where you can't build stuff as easily as a computer programmer, you might just write out what you are learning new. Apart from giving you a solid understanding of the subject matter, it will be a great point of discussing your motivation in the SoP and might also lead to your work getting recognized and perhaps giving you an upper hand when it comes to getting opportunities.

This section can be abbreviated simply by putting in the principle of **E(xplore)-L(earn)-B(uild)** before yourself. This is not limited to a good headstart for a successful application procedure but also if you want to make your sophomore years a better learning experience without blaming too much on the institutions in which you are studying. As a matter of fact, you should always keep talking about what you are learning with people like you *(internet is a great resource for that)* and even with the masters of the field. Who knows when you might meet someone who can help you out!

## Section 2: GRE, TOEFL and the Dawn of Applications
