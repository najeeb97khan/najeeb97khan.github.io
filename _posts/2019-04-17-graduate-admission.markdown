## What this blog is about?

Graduate Admission Process is a daunting task requiring a great deal of effort, patience and sometimes a whole lot of money. The money part is not always true and there are always niches where you can go about saving a whole lot. Sometimes, if you are smart enough, you can practically get everything done with the smallest amount of investment as possible. My story is pretty much the laterally inverted version of that but I hope that it can act as a subtle feedback mechanism for anyone who is trying to throw open doors of educating themselves abroad. This is an elaborate post regarding how and when I started to think about getting an education abroad, how I prepared myself to try get into some of the great colleges and how I failed, my expectations and the real world equivalent of them and how I chose when there were stark choices available, both financially and opportunity wise. I hope this post will help you out to make an educated decision and put your priorities in order when you take *(most probably)* the most investing decision of life.

## Getting Started

Getting started with the graduate admission requires some thinking and investment of time and is not something that can be done in a fortnight. So make sure that before you go about thinking of getting an education abroad, you have ample time (probably ~1 year or so) to make educated decisions, apply for colleges, get feedback and go through the whole shebang of financial agreements and visa procedures. I have had my fair share of applying to colleges in the United States of America, Canada and Germany, so I would describe the timeframe according to the universities that I applied. The deadlines change depending on countries and even on universities so make sure to keep watching out respective universities' website for the most credible information.

I will divide this blog post into *num_section* where each section will develop on sections preceding it. The sections are divided on the basis of time frames *i.e.* when I started preparing for the exams relevant to the procedure, when I started applying, approximately when I made the decision and finally when I decided to leave. Feel free to skip a section if it is something that you know. I will link the particular section as I refer it in the subsequent sections.
