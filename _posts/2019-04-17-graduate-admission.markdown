## What this blog post is about?
Graduate Admission Process is a daunting task requiring a great deal of effort, patience and sometimes money. The money part is not always true and there are always niches where you can go about saving a whole lot. Sometimes, if you are smart enough, you can practically get everything done with the smallest amount of investment as possible. Honestly, my story is pretty much the laterally inverted version of that but I hope that it can act as a subtle feedback mechanism for anyone who is trying to throw open doors of educating themselves abroad. This is an elaborate post regarding how and when I started to think about getting an education abroad, how I prepared myself to try to get into some of the great colleges and how I failed a bunch of times, my expectations and the real world equivalent of them and how I chose when there were stark choices available, both financially and opportunity wise. I hope this post will help you out to make an educated decision and put your priorities in order when you take *(most probably)* the most investing decision of life. If you want to know more about me, where to reach out and what I do [click here](https://najeeb97khan.github.io/about/).


## Getting Started

Getting started with the graduate admission process requires thinking and investment of time and cannot be done in a fortnight. Make sure that before you go about thinking of getting an education abroad, you have ample time (probably \~1 year or so) to make educated decisions, apply for colleges, get feedback and go through the whole shebang of financial agreements and visa procedures. I have had my fair share of applying to colleges in the United States of America, Canada and Germany so I would describe the timeframe according to the universities that I applied. The deadlines change depending on countries and even on universities so make sure to keep watching out respective universities' website for the most credible information.


I have divided this blog post into three sections where each section will develop on sections preceding it. The sections are divided on the basis of time frames *i.e.* when I started preparing for the exams relevant to the admissions, when I started applying, approximately when I made the decision and finally when I decided to leave. Feel free to skip a section if it is something that you already know. I will link the particular sections as I refer to them in the subsequent ones (if any).


## Section 1: The Sophomore Years of Undergraduate

There can be quite a lot of reasons why you would want to apply for a higher education degree and there might be a whole lot of other reasons why you would want to get it from abroad. These might range from gaining knowledge and experience from the best people in your chosen field of expertise, can be as simple as getting a taste of an exquisite culture or perhaps a blend of all those. For me, personally, it was during my sophomore years of the undergraduate degree that I started to think about going for higher education abroad. I really liked my field of study I was pursuing but perhaps in my own way I wanted more out of it. I did not have any predilection towards the curriculum which I was following and although I was scoring good marks at the university, I wasn't sure that I was being positively challenged enough to collaborate and think about the issues at hand *(this still has remained an issue but I believe I am making some progress thanks to the great community and courses around)*. The other push for me was to experience how life is beyond the border and how the geographical, topological and social characteristics define the personality of a person. In a nutshell, I wanted to see how I can gain more out of my work and life whilst also gaining knowledge.

Subsequently, I decided to look out for what it takes to get yourself in a position to start applying for higher education abroad and my observations can be distilled into two main points:

* **Decide on what you want to pursue when you graduate**

  Deciding early on what you want to pursue when you graduate can be helpful when you go on developing your Resume and Statement of Purpose *(more about that later)*. Having said that, it is not a requirement that once you decided what you want to pursue you cannot change it along the way. Humans fumble and interests change even when you are completely focussed on something at hand *(especially during your undergraduate timeframe when you don't have a lot of experience with the field of study)*. So let yourself wander a bit but make sure when you pick up something to work upon, make it see the light of the day and don't leave it dangling. Everything that you pick up might look fairly flowery at the beginning *(akin to typing Hello World in your newly learned programming language)* but there exists a steep learning curve. Making sure sticking to your learning during that steep curve will help you not even make something out of it without wasting time but will also help you in subsequent projects when you find something else to work upon *(as you find new opportunities in other fields and want to pursue them)*. I made mistakes trying to go through a whole lot of things during my sophomore year and not sticking to learning enough and that wasted quite a lot of my time that could have been put to some good use in building interesting things.

* **Keep building stuff ... even when you feel like reinventing the wheel**

  As a general rule of thumb when applying for great institutions abroad is to have a motivation that makes you pursue your chosen field of study and the ability to express it with your actions. Every institution would ask you to either send them a Statement of Purpose (SoP) or to send them an essay delineating your motivation and past experiences. The best way to tackle this *rather intimidating* piece of text is to get yourself building stuff. If you are pursuing a computer science degree *(as I was)*, you might want to go around building interesting web/mobile applications that tackle some problem to better showcase your work or if you are from a field where you can't build stuff as easily as a computer programmer, you might just write out what you are learning new. Apart from giving you a solid understanding of the subject matter, it will be a great point of discussing your motivation in the SoP and might also lead to your work getting recognized. Perhaps, it might also give you an upper hand when it comes to getting opportunities. You might try to learn new technologies to solve problems around you which can be a soaring point to talk about in the SoP. Simply said, building things is the fastest way to learn and putting it to use to create tangible products that can be talked about. Another way is not to build products but rather *research*. This might require more patience as you go on a journey to read and study your chosen field of expertise. Make sure that if you are doing research, you bring it into existence with the help of a research paper or an article. These recognised articles (in conferences, journals etc.) can help you stand out in your profile eventually giving a better impression to the admission committee.

This section can be abbreviated simply by putting before yourself the principle of **E(xplore)-L(earn)-B(uild)**. This is not only limited to a good headstart for a successful application procedure but also if you want to make your sophomore years a better learning experience without blaming too much on the institutions in which you are studying. As a matter of fact, you should always keep talking about what you are learning with people like you *(internet is a great resource for that)* and even with the masters of the field. Who knows when you might meet someone who can help you out!


## Section 2: GRE, TOEFL and the Dawn of Applications

</p>

Ideally, you should start your preparation for the standardized tests a year and a half before joining the program of choice at your preferred university. Say you are applying for the Fall/Winter Semester (August - October) of 2018 at the university, then you should start preparing for the standardized tests during April-May of 2017 so that you have ample time to prepare, give these test and be ready (comfortably) with the scores before the application deadlines end. In the subsequent sections, I would talk a little about the two standardized tests, namely Graduate Record Examination(GRE) and Test for English as a Foreign Language(TOEFL) and a bit about how to approach the application procedure.


### Section 2.1 Graduate Record Examination (GRE)

GRE is one of the standardized tests that most of the universities abroad ask for when applying for postgraduate courses in almost all the fields of expertise except business and management (Look at GMAT for that). For undergraduate courses, SAT acts as a standardized measure but I won't be going into its details. 

GRE consists of three parts, namely, Analytical Writing and Analysis, Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning. The cost of the registration for the exam is $150 but you can find the exact price according to their official website [here](https://www.ets.org/gre). Keep in mind that the official website is the best and most accurate source of information regarding the pattern of examination and other fine details. I would recommend you to head [here](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about/content/) if you want to learn more. The preparation of GRE resolves around the following three principles:

1. **Getting to know the paper**
   
   As you might have heard that GRE is not  tough examination which tests your subject-specific knowledge but assesses your fundamental reasoning and interpretation skills. Given that, the quantitative aptitude paper revolves around simple (high school) mathematical concepts and the verbal reasoning revolves around English language skills and its underlying *(mostly cryptic)* vocabulary. Giving yourself ample time to understand the paper as you start going through the underlying subject matter is important for any exam but more so for GRE. The pattern of how and what type of questions are asked and how the solutions as well as the questions are presented can help in getting a fair idea about how to mentally prepare for the exam. Even if you are comfortable with the subject matter of GRE, it will be difficult to score in the above-said sections if you take a whole lot of time deciphering how to answer. So make yourself comfortable with how questions are presented and what is the best way to reason about the solution for a specific question.

2. **Procuring the study material**
   
   The next thing for preparation is procuring the right study material and there are a bundle of choices that can be made for that. The best way  is to get materials from coaching institutes or buy them online so that you have enough questions to practice around. The most important part is to go through the [ETS workbooks](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/?WT.ac=gre_prepare_170731) and make sure you understand the latest pattern of questions. I personally practised from the following four sources for added confidence:
   * Jamboree practice books for both verbal and quant
   * Manhattan 5lb book for Reading Comprehensions
   * ETS Official Guide
   Another important bit is to get sufficiently acquainted with the exam scenario so as to mould your thinking ability into that direction. For this, I would recommend giving as many practise tests as possible. Effectively gauging performance helps in improving through areas where one is weak rather than blindly practising a bunch of verbal questions and rote learning the vocabulary *(that you need to do nonetheless)*. I used these four resources to practice tests and you might also find them useful:
   * Kaplan Tests: Easy and good for starting out.
   * Jamboree Tests: More than enough difficult so difficult to gauge but nonetheless *God mode practice*.
   * ETS Official Tests: There are 2 sets of tests from ETS. Give one a month and a half before the actual exam date and give the other one a week before the exam to effectively gauge your performance.
   * Manhattan Test: Good practice in general.

3. **What about Analytical Writing and Assesment?**  
   
   Analytical Writing and Assesment, abbreviated as AWA, should be given the least effort when preparing (it might be different when the subject you are applying at the university requires you to have advanced writing skills such as English Literature). But said that you MUST NOT take it lightly. Even if you got a perfect score in Quant and Verbal and a really poor score in AWA, you might have to give the test again. Most of the institutions have a minimum score for AWA and getting a score above or equal to 3.5 is enough to qualify for most. To prepare for AWA, read as much example scenarios and responses as possible and try to imitate the writing style when framing your own response. Whenever you are giving the full test as part of your preparation, make sure you also give AWA with it and analyse the written response by yourself. It will help you get into comfortable in dealing with AWA during the start of the test whilst also not spending too much of energy on this task.

In the end, GRE is all about practise. The more you practise, the more you have prior experience with the types of questions and the better you can score in the exam. I would advise to sufficiently give time practising quant as it can help you score better rather than dilly-dallying on verbal for the maximum amount time.

### Section 2.2 Test for English as a Foreign Language (ToEFL)

ToEFL focusses solely on English skills and contains four sections for testing speaking, writing, reading and listening skills of the test taker. If you have already prepared for GRE then it is relatively easier to get a good score in ToEFL. The tests do not comprise of the cryptic vocabulary you might find in GRE. The vocabulary and texts are simple and pretty straightforward. The easiest way to prepare for ToEFL is to give sample tests which can be purchased from a vendor online or procured from coaching institutes. There is no need to go through excessive vocabulary for this test. Giving ToEFL official test (if I remember right it is a set of 10 tests) will be enough to get you a score above 90 and perhaps even above 100. Remember ToEFL exists as a formal requirement for many institutions abroad and most of them ask for a base score between 90 - 100 (depending on the country where you are applying). The cost of the test is around $120 so make sure that you prepare enough that you don't need to give it more than once. The results of ToEFL arrive through E-mail in under 15 days so make sure that there is ample time between the deadline of applications and the arrival of ToEFL results. You can find most of the information on the official ToEFL website [here](https://www.ets.org/toefl)

### Section 2.3 The application procedure

The application procedure varies greatly from university to university and the country where university exists. On the contrary, there exist some generalisations among the applications that can be prepared in advance so that one can have a smooth application procedure. It is highly recommended to keep checking out the deadlines for universities by going to their admission page and keep a checklist of what documents need to be sent and how. In this subsection, I will try and delineate some general components of the application procedure which can give you an idea of what your prospective universities can ask for.

  1. **Test Scores**:
     
     Test Scores for standardized exams such as GRE and ToEFL/IELTS are almost exclusively asked by all the institutions in North America. For institutions in Europe, however, it might depend on the university and the course you are applying for. Almost all of the institutions will ask for ToEFL/IELTS score as a fulfilment of language requirements. The scores are sent electronically after the examination is finished. You get to send scores to 4 universities for free in GRE and ToEFL (as soon as the test ends for GRE and during registration for ToEFL) and sending the rest of scores will require you to submit an additional fee of $27 and $20 for GRE and ToEFL respectively. Make sure to note the institution code by browsing the university admission webpage when sending your scores to avoid any mistake.

  2. **Letters of Recommendation**:
     
     Letters of Recommendations, abbreviated as LoR, are one of the most important and most common parts of the application procedure. These LoRs should be given from either your academic advisors (professors or research advisor) or can be given by someone from your organisation if you are a working professional. Make sure to check from the university website what type of Letter of Recommendation they require. A nice combination is to get two LoRs from your university professors and an LoR from industry professional/research advisor allowing you to give enough variety of recommendations from both academia and industry. Who you get your LoRs from makes a lot of difference. If someone who stands tall in the academic community gives you an LoR, then it will make a substantial impact on your application procedure. Make sure you have cultivated a relationship with whom you are being recommended and have done either some projects or worked directly under them. Mostly, LoRs are sent electronically and the professor to whom you have submitted as a recommender will receive a link to directly upload an LoR in PDF/Word format. In addition, the recommender might also have to fill in a questionnaire having behavioural questions regarding the recommended person.

  3. **Statement of Purpose**:
     
     Statement of Purpose has the same level of importance as LoRs and acts as a motivation for the study program that you are applying to. Make sure that you give enough time in framing and writing the Statement of Purpose and get it thoroughly checked so as to make it free from any grammatical errors, incorrect semantical and syntactical structures and sub-standard word choice. Writing an SoP is a personal matter and depends from person to person. There are a couple of things that one should keep in mind to effectively transfer the thoughts in an effective manner onto the paper.
     * Make sure that the SoP is neither too short and nor too long. Most of the institutions might give the guidelines for writing down the SoP. Make sure that you follow the number of words and the length of the SoP. Writing down an SoP in a verbose manner makes it difficult for the person assessing it and they might end up considering it pedestrian.
     * The SoP should contain the theme of motivation for why you are choosing that specific program at the university and how you got to be motivated to pursue that particular area of study. You can delineate the different paths that you took during your undergraduate degree and how they framed your thought process into applying to the specific program at the university.
     * The SoP must follow the formal rules of English grammar. Remember that the statement is read by people of the admission committee and although it is not a problem to add a hint of humour sometimes, but make sure it does not cause offence or is in poor taste.
     * The statement should be divided into paragraphs and should not consist of a single block of text. Each paragraph should somewhat connect and lead onto another paragraph's theme while delineating the purpose of the text.

     You can find a lot of instructions about how to write a statement of purpose online. It is advisable to go through one of them and have an idea about what and how to write in the back of your head. It is normal to make big revisions in your text as you go on writing about it in the first place. It is also normal to take a whole lot of time in completing it. If you don't know how to get started with the statement, look at some sample statements online to get an idea of how to start.

  4. **Transcripts of Records**

     A transcript of records is issued by the attending university containing the collection of subjects and their grades with the university stamp and seal.

     The universities will ask you to either send a hardcopy of your transcripts of records or scan and upload them on the admission portal. It is advisable to have 3-4 sets of transcripts with yourself with one unsealed set for the purpose of scanning. The sealed envelope should not be opened otherwise it might compromise the integrity of the transcripts and the university might not accept it as valid. Make sure to adhere to the guidelines provided by the university when you are sending your documents. Also, make sure to keep in check that the documents should reach before the application deadline.

## Section 3: The Date with the Consulate

Getting your visa is the next step when you have been admitted and have made the choice to attend the university. The visa documents might vary from country to country and would highly depend on what type of visa you need to attend the university. In this section, let us delve into the most fundamental part of the visa documents *i.e* getting your finances in order.

The finances play a major part in getting a visa to the country where you will be attending your university. Depending on the type of admission that you have secured there might exist four scenarios:
  * **The university has no tuition fee but you have no assistance**
     In most of the public institutions in Germany, it is the case that you don't have any semester-wise tuition fee that you need to submit as you move from semester to semester. However, it doesn't mean that you don't have to prove your ability to sustain yourself financially. For this, you might need to show proof of an amount that the country agrees upon. For example, for Germany, this amounts to showing 8620 Euros. Being a huge amount, make sure that you have enough time to approach banks, financial advisors, Non-Banking Financial Corporations (NBFCs) etc. to credit that much of amount in your bank account. The bank account might itself be in your name in country where the university is located, as is the case in Germany.

  * **The university has no tuition fee and you assistance**
     If you have obtained some kind of financial assistance such as a scholarship, then it is wiser to contact the consulate or go through their guidelines to find out what kind of document you need to present at the visa interview. Normally, it would be a letter from the organisation/university granting you assistance. Make sure to confirm from the consulate whether the scholarship/assistance is valid for the type of visa you are applying for.

  * **The university has tuition fee and you have no assistance**
     Students when applying to the universities are in this kind of situation. You need to make sure that you have the ability to show sustenance for a whole year of staying in the country of university. The consulate website will give you a better idea but normally it amounts to the combination of tuition fee that you need to pay per year and the living expenses of the city where the university is located.

  * **The university has tuition and you have assistance**
     This case is parallel to the case where you have no tuition fee but have assistance. Additionally, the amount that you are getting from the assistance should be enough to help you sustain yourself in the country where you are applying for the visa after you have paid the tuition.

  As said before, the visa procedure depends highly on the country as well as the university. The essence of this section is to make you aware that you need to start thinking about the finances before you take the visa interview and make sure that you have enough evidence to support the claim to sustain yourself in the foreign country.

## Bonus Section: What I learned

Having given a general idea of how a typical admission procedure might look like and what you need to do to get it done, I would like to end this post with a series of observations that I made while applying to a bunch of schools throughout the world and how it helped mould my expectations and thought process as I went further to attend the university perhaps I did not look forward to during my undergraduate. These observations are purely my personal viewpoints and you may or may not agree with them. Still, it is nice to put my experiences in black and white so that you might have someone to correlate and gauge your own experiences:

 * The path to getting admitted to a good college is not something to be achieved in a fortnight. You should keep working on it with careful planning to make out as much as possible of the money and effort that you are putting in getting what you want. Yet you must not take home with yourself a whole lot of expectations. In the world of competition and excellence, the standards are getting higher by the day and things are pretty volatile. Getting disheartened by results is pretty normal and you should be both ready to cope with them and act on them in the future. Believing that there is an abundance of opportunities out there will keep you going for what you want in the long run.

 * Aim for what suits you the best and not what is the best. Getting into prominent universities is a commendable feat and can help you a lot in the future. You must keep in mind that you should look out for universities that suit you the best. Some universities might not be in the top rankings but might have great programmes. Some might have great programmes and a great reputation but might lead you into financial insecurity when you graduate. Keep all these things while making the list of universities that you are applying to and it might help you efficiently choose the universities rather than throwing your money down the drain for universities that you cannot attend even when gotten into.

 * Keep in your mind the reason why you want to attend the university in a particular country. It is perfectly normal to go to a country just because life looks great on the other side. This can be a great motivation but might come with the cost of leaving your family and loved ones behind. Look into the pros and cons and make the right decision. If you can't comprehend what it would feel like leaving everything behind, I would say give it a try. You can always go through the experience and come back to your home country to see it with a whole different perspective. Perhaps it might be really difficult for you to leave your family when making the final call. I would advise talking to your friends and family to make decision that can make you happier in the longer run. Remember, going to a foreign country and settling up there might not be the panacea that you are looking for.

 * Learn and respect the culture of the place that you are moving to. Everywhere around the world people have different perspectives of looking into the world. This affects how, we as humans, think and solve problems. Going to a different country for your studies is a one of a kind gateway to go about experiencing and learning the culture of the place you are moving to. Don't confine yourself into the barriers of studies but rather meet people of the country where you are going. For me, it has been really difficult *(partly because of the language barrier and my rather disappointing social anxiousness)* but perhaps you can make the better out of it. All of the times I have tried understanding the place and people where I am pursuing my education, it has helped me make more realistic decisions about what I expect from a place rather than the brick and mortar which makes it up. Having said that I still love skyscrapers, so New York all the way! *(smileys)*

I would like to end this post by remarking that this is not an exhaustive preparation guide for success in admission to graduate programs abroad but just an honest attempt to impart knowledge that I gained. For this, I would like to thank everyone who has supported me throughout the journey and continues to do so. My friends and family have been a great source of support. I can't thank enough my parents who put in everything they got so that I can achieve what I wanted to. I hope you get something out of this post and can make a more educated decision about your *pursuit of happyness*.
