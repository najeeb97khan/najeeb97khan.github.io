Hi I am Najeeb Khan, a computer science undergrad @ Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.
I have been an amateur data scientist and machine learning practitioner from the past year. I have tried my hands with quite a lot of technologies and have started research in Image recognition techniques using Deep Learning.
I am a regular participant @ Kaggle competitions and maintain a small collection of codes that I wrote for various competitions (although some gave very bad results). You can check out my github profile for my solutions to various competition (don't forget to star).
