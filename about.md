I am pursuing masters in informatics from Technical University of Munich, Germany majoring in Machine Leanring and Computer Vision. I have done some on and off research in the field of Machine Learning back during my undergraduation and wish to get more thorough with it during my masters study. You can check out my personal webpage for a glance of these projects @ [http://najeeb97khan.herokuapp.com](http://najeeb97khan.herokuapp.com)
I have also been a  participant @ Kaggle competitions and maintain a small collection of codes that I wrote for various competitions (although some gave very weird results). You can check out my github profile for my solutions to various competition (don't forget to star) and also bits of codes that I wrote while experimenting with various DL tasks.
